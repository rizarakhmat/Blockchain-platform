# Platform on Private Blockchain Network for Public Service Media Exchange

This project aims to create a private blockchain network for facilitating the exchange of public service media content. The network ensures secure and transparent transactions of media assets while maintaining privacy and authenticity.

## Project Structure

The repository consists of two main folders:

1. **Client**: This folder contains the front-end JavaScript application responsible for interacting with the blockchain network. Users can have different role, based on which has different access rights and interface.

2. **Web3**: This folder contains the smart contracts written in Solidity for managing the transactions and interactions within the blockchain network. These contracts define the rules and operations governing the exchange of media assets.

## Features

- **Secure Media Exchange**: Utilizes blockchain technology to ensure secure and tamper-proof exchange of media content.
  
- **Transparency**: All transactions within the network are transparent and verifiable, enhancing trust among participants.

- **Privacy**: Despite transparency, user privacy is maintained through cryptographic techniques ensuring confidentiality of sensitive information.

- **Decentralized**: The network operates in a decentralized manner, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing transaction costs.

## Functionalities 

- **Crouwdfunding**: Allows community to crowdfund the media production.

- **Identity Management**: Allows anable access controll to the platform.

- **NFT**: Media content is represented as NFT on the platform.

- **Fractionalized NFT**: Allows the co-owenership of the media content between the co-funders.

- **Management of distribution**: The regulation of distribution rights, streaming licenses and remuneration of the royalties after the media production will be realised to the audience.
